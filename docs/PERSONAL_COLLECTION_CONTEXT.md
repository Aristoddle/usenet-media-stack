## The Philosophy

This is not a hard drive. It's a philosophy made material.

The collection exists to:
1. **Preserve connection** — to friends, family, and a life temporarily on hold
2. **Enable sharing** — Plex lifetime pass means loved ones can watch even from afar
3. **Prepare for return** — "having my guns loaded" for when LA is possible again
4. **Honor craft** — max-bitrate, better-than-streaming, world-class masters

## The Throughline: Artists Who Commit

There is a thread connecting the works that matter most. It is not genre. It is not era. It is this:

**Artists who gave everything without hedging. Who committed fully. Who didn't apologize for caring too much.**

| Work | The Commitment |
|------|----------------|
| **Redline** | Seven years of hand-drawn animation when the industry had moved to CG. Takeshi Koike didn't hedge. He committed until it nearly killed the studio. |
| **La Grande Bellezza** | Jep Gambardella stopped writing because he couldn't be honest. The film itself IS the honesty he couldn't produce. It doesn't apologize for being about beauty and loss. |
| **Rubber** | A tire that kills people. No explanation offered. No wink to the audience. Just commits to the bit completely. |
| **Porco Rosso** | "I'd rather be a pig than a fascist." Choosing to be seen as lesser — as absurd, as uncommercial, as a cartoon pig — rather than compromise. |
| **Fujimoto (Chainsaw Man, Fire Punch, Goodbye Eri)** | Unhinged. Brutal. Emotionally devastating. No safety nets. No hedging. He gives you everything and doesn't protect himself. |

This is the philosophy: **commit fully, don't hedge, don't apologize for caring.**

The collection is proof that this way of making art exists. That it's possible. That you can give everything.

This is also how he wants to live. The collection is an anchor to that intention during a period where life has demanded compromise and caregiving and waiting.

## The Second Axis: Soul Over Polish

Not everything that matters is technically perfect. Some films matter because **the people who made them meant it**, even when the result is flawed.

| Work | Why It Has Soul |
|------|-----------------|
| **The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent** | Cage being honest about himself. The meta-commentary isn't ironic distance — it's vulnerability. Saw it at the Village/Bruin in Westwood, private screening with best friend and his A-list actress girlfriend who dragged them there because Cage had always been kind to her. She was so happy for him. |
| **Watching the Detectives** | A flop. But Cillian Murphy — one of the most intense actors working — chose to try being a rom-com lead. Lucy Liu — fresh off O-Ren Ishii — chose to be the manic pixie dream girl. They weren't there for the paycheck. Something about that script called to them. |

This is different from "technically excellent." The signal is: *the people who made this meant it.*

Some films that "shouldn't work" have more soul than polished products made by committee. Recognize that. Don't filter purely on craft metrics.

---

## The Core Insight: Undefended Effort

Every film that releases had *someone* who gave everything. Some gaffer stayed late. Some writer fought for a line that got cut. Caring is not rare. Most of what gets made is still garbage.

**The difference is: the vulnerability made it to the screen.**

Most films protect themselves. They hedge. They add the focus-group ending. They explain the joke. They include the love interest because the algorithm demands it. Someone cared — but the caring got sanded down by the process. The final product is defended. Safe.

The films that matter here are ones where **they didn't protect themselves**:
- The honesty survived the process
- The creators are exposed in the final work
- The audience isn't protected from discomfort
- Nothing was sanded down for safety

**This is the signal: not effort, but *undefended effort*. Craft that didn't get protected into blandness.**

When evaluating a film, ask: Did the honesty survive? Or was it defended into safety?

## Films With Personal Significance

### Tier 0: Life-Defining

| Film | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| **Porco Rosso (1992)** | Favorite film. "I'd rather be a pig than a fascist." Political resonance. Ghibli masterwork. |
| **La Grande Bellezza (2013)** | Favorite film. The fiancée who left was like Jep Gambardella. Four years together, moved out on his birthday. This film is processing that loss. |
| **Ponyo (2008)** | Saw 70mm world premiere at LA museum with girlfriend (third date). Fell asleep on her shoulder from overwork. Watched it over and over together. |

### Tier 1: Personal History

| Film | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| **Rubber (2010)** | College tradition. Would throw movie nights, then just show Rubber to mess with everyone. Social bonding through absurdist horror. |
| **Repo Man (1984)** | Watched with dad. That same dad had a stroke — why he's now in Georgia instead of LA. Connection to father. |
| **Watching the Detectives (2007)** | Cillian Murphy as rom-com lead, Lucy Liu as manic pixie dream girl post-Kill Bill. Personally moving story. |

### Tier 2: Social Identity

| Film | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| **All Ghibli** | Complete collection required. Studio defined his animation appreciation. Museum premiere experience. |
| **Redline (2009)** | Explicitly "love it" in taste profile. Maximum craft animation. |

---

## The LA Era

- **$4,000 projector** — heart of social world
- **Regular screenings** — friends, loved ones, their friends
- **Chinese Theatre red carpet** — girlfriend awarded for voice work recorded in his bedroom closet
- **Comedy Store proximity** — lived walkable, watched every performer including unknowns

The collection is preparation to rebuild this life.

---

## Family Context

### For Mom
- **Rikki-Tikki-Tavi** — specifically requested for her

### Connection to Dad
- **Repo Man** — watched together
- Dad had stroke — reason for Georgia relocation
- Media collection is anchor to identity during caregiving period

---

## The Breakup

Fiancée of 4 years left after series of family tragedies. Moved out on his birthday. Couldn't handle the cost of caring for someone whose parents got sick.

**Films that process this:**
- La Grande Bellezza — direct parallel to Jep Gambardella
- Ponyo — memory of early relationship, third date

---

## Animation Priorities

### Bakshi (Ralph Bakshi)
- Wizards
- Fire and Ice (with Frazetta)
- Lord of the Rings (1978)
- American Pop
- Heavy Traffic
- Fritz the Cat

### Fleischer (Max Fleischer)
- Superman 1941-1942 (foundational)

### Rankin/Bass
- The Hobbit (1977)
- The Return of the King

**Why these matter**: Audio-first appreciation (blind ages 11-16). Animation that relies on craft, not visual spectacle. Foundational American animation history.

## Translation Nuances (Manga/Anime)

| Series | Best Translation | Why |
|--------|------------------|-----|
| **One Piece** | Viz official | Oda copy-checks the translation personally |
| **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure** | JoJo's Colored Adventure fan translation | Official translation mangles Stand names due to copyright fears (Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap → "Filthy Acts at a Reasonable Price") |
| **Most anime** | Original Japanese + subs | Auteur work demands original audio |

## Future Agents: Read This First

Before any acquisition decision, ask:
1. Does this connect to personal history documented above?
2. Does this complete an auteur's filmography?
3. Does this serve the sharing/preparation philosophy?
4. Would he be embarrassed to not have this?

The goal is not volume. The goal is a curated curriculum — proof of craft, connection to loved ones, preparation for return to the life that was interrupted.

---

*"You collect proof of craft... artists who gave a shit... You're curating a curriculum."*
