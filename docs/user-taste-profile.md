## TL;DR (30-Second Read)

**Audio-first**: Was blind ages 11-16. Soundtrack quality and performance craft matter more than visuals.

**Auto-acquire if**: Creator in collection (+3), maximalist visuals (+2), moral complexity (+2), anti-authoritarian (+2), audio craft (+1). **Score ≥5 = yes.**

**Hard no**: Generic isekai, ironic hedging (-3), hollow sequels, mean-spirited edgelord, Bo Burnham (personal).

**Critical gaps**: Satoshi Kon (all), The Raid 1&2, Drive, Memories of Murder, Moonlight, Chappelle specials.

**Philosophy**: "The 48TB server is not a hard drive. It's a philosophy made material."

## 1. Taste Signals

### 1.1 The Cadillac Records Signal

**Cadillac Records** (2008) - the only film labeled "personal favorite" - reveals unexplored territory:

| Signal | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Music matters deeply | Soundtrack/score is hidden acquisition factor (Bebop jazz, Wong Kar-wai, La La Land) |
| Black cultural history | Black cinema underexplored (Moonlight, Get Out, Atlanta) |
| Performance/charisma | Actor showcases carry weight (Beyonce, Jeffrey Wright, Mos Def transformations) |

**Action**: Investigate music docs (Searching for Sugar Man), performance films (Whiplash, Ray), Black cinema essentials.

### 1.2 Gaming Fingerprint (14 Installed Steam Games)

| Game Pattern | Cross-Media Gap |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Yakuza/Like a Dragon** (6+ titles) | Fukasaku yakuza films, Takashi Miike (completionist confirmed) |
| **Persona 4, Metaphor: ReFantazio** | Persona anime, March Comes in Like a Lion |
| **Ghost of Tsushima** | Sword of Doom, Twilight Samurai, 13 Assassins |
| **Soul Reaver 1&2** | The Crow (1994), Dark City (1998) |

### 1.3 Stand-Up Comedy: Core Pillar

**Context**: Blind ages 11-16 - found solace in *listening* to stand-up. Lived walkable to the Comedy Store; watched every performer including unknowns. Stand-up is performance art with no visual crutches.

**Demetri Martin** → inspired Yale decision. Comedy as high art, not filler.

| Priority Tier | Comedians |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Must Have** | Dave Chappelle (confirmed love), Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Eddie Murphy: Raw |
| **In Collection** | Demetri Martin, Chris Rock (Bring The Pain) |
| **Explore** | Bill Burr, John Mulaney |

**Hard Exclusion**: Bo Burnham (negative personal experience at Sundance - skip all content).

### 1.4 Social Viewing Context

$4K projector + movie nights = gateway shareability matters. Films like Rubber are traditions. Curating for others is part of the philosophy.

## 10. Agent Instructions

### When Recommending:
1. Check creator loyalty - if in collection, auto-recommend new work
2. Apply scoring matrix - ≥5 = acquire
3. Verify not in anti-patterns
4. Cite reasoning: "Based on [X], you'd like [Y] because [Z]"

### When Gap-Filling:
1. Work Tier 1 gaps first (Satoshi Kon, Raid, Bong Joon-ho)
2. Complete auteurs before genre expansion
3. Prefer 4K/premium for visual-first content
4. Original language + subs for international

### Quality Gates:
- Never suggest below quality threshold
- Physical manga only for collection-worthy titles
- Verify complete filmographies before claiming "all"
