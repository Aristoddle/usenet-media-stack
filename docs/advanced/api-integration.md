# API Integration Guide

This document captures the automation patterns previously maintained in
`codex/collab/api-integration.md`. The guidance has been validated against
the production Usenet Media Stack CLI and current service versions.

## Core Principles

1. **Treat every service as stateless.** Persist data in volumes that are
   already part of the storage profiles generated by `usenet storage`.
2. **Use the CLI as your entry point.** The `./usenet services` commands
   ensure authentication, hostnames, and port mappings stay consistent.
3. **Respect rate limits.** Public APIs such as Overseerr or Prowlarr
   enforce throttling; queue automation jobs instead of firing bursts.

## Service Authentication Matrix

| Service      | Auth Source           | Token Scope            |
|--------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Overseerr    | `config/overseerr`    | `read` + `manage`      |
| Prowlarr     | `config/prowlarr`     | Indexer CRUD           |
| Sonarr/Radarr| `config/*/config.xml` | Full automation        |
| Plex         | `config/plex`         | Library management     |
| Bazarr       | `config/bazarr`       | Subtitle sync          |

Tokens are rotated automatically when you run `./usenet backup create`.
Store rotation logs in your password manager to keep track of changes.

## Automation Workflow

1. Request an API key through the service web UI.
2. Store the key in the `.env` overlay managed by `./usenet env edit`.
3. Extend the CLI by creating a shell script under `lib/commands` that
   exports `USENET_ENV` before invoking curl or python clients.
4. Add the script to the completions file so the command appears in the
   interactive help.

## Example: Creating a Custom Overseerr Import

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

source "$(dirname "$0")/../lib/core/bootstrap.sh"
API_KEY=$(usenet env get OVERSEERR_TOKEN)
BASE_URL=$(usenet services url overseerr)

curl -sS -X POST "$BASE_URL/api/v1/imports" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"name\":\"library-sync\",\"enabled\":true}"
```

Run the script with `./usenet custom overseerr-import`. The CLI context
resolves the container hostname, so this works on localhost and tunnels.

## Webhook Integration

- Prefer HTTPS webhooks through the Cloudflare tunnel exposed by the
  stack. Create DNS entries in `config/tunnel/records.yml`.
- Queue heavy jobs with `usenet services exec <service> -- enqueue` to
  avoid blocking the webhook sender.
- Version control webhook payloads alongside the scripts that consume
  them so you can diff changes triggered by upstream providers.

## Monitoring and Auditing

- Enable Netdata integration by posting metrics to `localhost:8125`.
- Log every automation run to `/var/log/usenet-automation.log` inside the
  control host. Forward logs with the existing Loki pipeline if enabled.
- Review API key usage weekly; revoke stale credentials via the CLI.
