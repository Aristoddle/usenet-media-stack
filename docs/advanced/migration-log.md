- `api-integration.md`: `codex/collab/api-integration.md`
  → `docs/advanced/api-integration.md`
- `backup-strategies.md`: `codex/collab/backup-strategies.md`
  → `docs/advanced/backup-strategies.md`
- `custom-configs.md`: `codex/collab/custom-configs.md`
  → `docs/advanced/custom-configs.md`
- `hot-swap.md`: `codex/collab/hot-swap.md`

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Content reviewed for accuracy against current production workflows.
- [x] Internal links updated to reflect new directory structure.
- [x] Front matter normalised for the documentation site generator.
- [x] Migration recorded in repository history with this log.

## Next Steps

- Publish the updated documentation site to ensure navigation includes the
  Advanced section.
- Archive the legacy `codex/collab` workspace or mark it read-only to avoid
  future divergence.
