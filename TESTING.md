# ðŸ§ª Local Stack Validation

This guide shows how to spin up the Usenet Media Stack locally and
run the Playwright-based validation script.

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+

## Steps

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm ci
   npx playwright install --with-deps
   ```

2. Start the stack:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. Run the validation script:
