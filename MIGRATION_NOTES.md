# Migration Notes

## Legacy Home Media Server Integration

**Date**: December 2024  
**Action**: Merged standalone Samba/NFS configuration into unified media automation stack

### What was merged:

1. **Legacy Repository**: `/home/joe/Documents/Code/home-media-server/`
   - Standalone Samba/NFS file sharing configuration
   - Basic service management scripts
   - Example configuration files

2. **Integration Points**:
   - Samba and NFS services added to `docker-compose.yml`
   - File sharing functionality integrated into `manage.sh` script
   - Configuration examples preserved in `config/examples/`
   - Legacy scripts preserved in `scripts/legacy/`

### Key Improvements:

- **Unified Stack**: All services now deployed together
- **Docker Swarm Ready**: Multi-device deployment support
- **Enhanced Security**: Integrated firewall and security hardening
- **Better Management**: Single script for all operations
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Complete guides for all aspects

### Legacy Files Preserved:

```
config/examples/
├── smb.conf.example     # Original Samba configuration
└── exports.example      # Original NFS exports

scripts/legacy/
├── check-services.sh    # Original service checking
└── create-share.sh      # Original share creation
```

### Migration Path:

1. **Old Setup**: Manual Samba/NFS + separate *arr services
2. **New Setup**: Unified Docker stack with integrated file sharing
3. **Benefits**: 
   - Single point of management
   - Docker Swarm scalability
   - Automated deployment
   - Security hardening
   - Complete monitoring

### Backward Compatibility:

The new stack provides all functionality of the old setup plus:
- Automated installation
- Security configuration
- Multi-device support
- Enhanced monitoring
- Backup automation

**Note**: The legacy `/home/joe/Documents/Code/home-media-server/` directory can be safely removed after confirming the new stack works correctly.
