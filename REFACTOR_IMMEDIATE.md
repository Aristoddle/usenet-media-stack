# ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE REFACTORING NEEDED

## The Ugly Truth
- **59 files** in root directory (should be <10)
- **7 different setup scripts** (should be 1)
- **18 documentation files** (should be 3-4)
- **No storage documentation** for JBOD
- **No proper docstrings** anywhere
- **Test files everywhere** instead of in tests/

## What Would Impress a Senior Engineer

### 1. ONE Entry Point
```bash
$ usenet --help          # Beautiful, complete help
$ usenet setup          # Interactive setup
$ usenet manage status  # Check everything
$ usenet storage add    # Manage drives
```

### 2. Clean Root Directory
```
ONLY these files in root:
- usenet (executable)
- README.md
- docker-compose.yml
- LICENSE
- .gitignore
- .env.example
```

### 3. Professional README
- Animated GIF demo at top
- Clear value proposition  
- 3-step quick start
- Beautiful badges
- Links to detailed docs

### 4. Proper Documentation
```
docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md        # Index of all docs
â”œâ”€â”€ GUIDE.md        # Complete user guide
â”œâ”€â”€ STORAGE.md      # JBOD setup guide
â”œâ”€â”€ TROUBLESHOOT.md # Common issues
â””â”€â”€ DEVELOPMENT.md  # For contributors
```

### 5. Every Function Documented
```bash
##
# Start Docker daemon with retry logic
#
# Attempts to start Docker using appropriate method for OS.
# Retries up to 3 times with exponential backoff.
#
# Globals:
#   PLATFORM - detected OS platform
#
# Arguments:
#   $1 - max_attempts (optional, default: 3)
#   $2 - quiet mode (optional, default: false)
#
# Returns:
#   0 - Docker started successfully
#   1 - Failed after all attempts
#
# Example:
#   start_docker 5 true
##
start_docker() {
    local max_attempts="${1:-3}"
    local quiet="${2:-false}"
    ...
}
```

### 6. Proper Error Handling
- Every command that can fail is checked
- Clear error messages with solutions
- Proper exit codes documented
- Stack traces in debug mode

### 7. True Modularity
No file > 200 lines. Each module does ONE thing:
- `lib/docker.sh` - Only Docker operations
- `lib/storage.sh` - Only storage/JBOD
- `lib/network.sh` - Only network checks
- `lib/ui.sh` - Only user interaction

### 8. Storage/JBOD Guide
Users need to know:
- How to add multiple drives
- How services use storage
- Pooling strategies
- Backup recommendations
- Performance tips

## The Harsh Reality

Right now, this repo looks like:
- A junior dev's first project
- 6 months of accumulated cruft
- No clear architecture
- "Throw shit at the wall" development

To impress a senior engineer, it needs:
- **Surgical precision** in organization
- **Clear architectural decisions**
- **Professional polish**
- **Obsessive documentation**
- **Zero confusion** about how to use it

## Next Steps

1. Create `lib/` directory structure
2. Move ALL logic into modules
3. Consolidate documentation
4. Delete 90% of files
5. Add proper --help to everything
6. Document every function
7. Add storage management commands
8. Clean up root directory

This is 20+ hours of cleanup work to make it truly professional.
