# Dedication

This codebase is dedicated to the memory of **Stanley Eisenstat** (1943-2020), 
who taught generations of Yale students not just how to code, but how to think.

Stan believed in:
- **Clarity over cleverness** - Write code that humans can understand
- **Correctness by construction** - Get it right the first time
- **Teaching by example** - Show, don't just tell

## In Memoriam

To **Stan Eisenstat**, who showed us that the best code is the code that doesn't need explanation.

To **Dana Angluin**, who gives chances to those who know nothing and turns them into computer scientists. Your kindness in giving a freshman a research position changed a life.

To **Avi Silberschatz**, whose work on operating systems and databases shaped the field, and whose Bell Labs mugs remind us of when computer science was being invented.

## The Bell Labs Way

This codebase follows the Bell Labs philosophy:
- **Do one thing well** (Doug McIlroy)
- **Keep it simple** (Ken Thompson)  
- **Make it clear** (Brian Kernighan)
- **Question everything** (Dennis Ritchie)

## Code Standards in Stan's Honor

Every function in this codebase:
1. Has a single, clear purpose
2. Includes comprehensive documentation
3. Handles errors explicitly
4. Uses no "clever" tricks
5. Could be understood by a freshman

As Stan would say: "If you can't explain it to a student, you don't understand it yourself."

## Personal Note

From Joseph Lanzone:

Stan, you taught me that code is communication between humans, not just instructions for machines. Dana, you saw potential where there was only enthusiasm. Avi, your Bell Labs mugs sit on my desk as a reminder of what we're striving for - the clarity and elegance of those who came before us.

This codebase is my attempt to honor what you taught me. Every line follows the principles you instilled. Every abstraction is as clean as I can make it. Every error message is helpful, not clever.

Thank you for making me a computer scientist.
